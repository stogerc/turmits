My simple and dirty turmits interpreter written in c++, with glut and FLTK.

To run turmite file use -t key? and define turmite file name after key,example:
./turm -t brains/langton
To run cellular automata rule use -f key, to run elementary automata rule, like rule110 use -r key.

SYNTAX
Turmite brain file consit of lines, where which line consist of 5 parts:
<qrrent state> <qrrent cell color> <new cell color> <where to turn> <new state>
, example:
a_state 1 12 0 b_state
Statement can take as value any string, and <*> to match any state, or if it new state field, it means not to change qrrent state. Color must be any number between 0 and 15 inclusive, and -1 to match any color, or if it new color field, -1 means not to change the color of cell. Rotate field must be 1, if you want to rotate by clockwise, -1 to rotate ounterclockwise, 0 means not rotate, and 2 means U rotate (by 180 degrees). Comments must begins with ';' symbol. Number of allowed steps must begins with '#' symbol. Cellular automata and elementary cellular automata do not support comments and num of steps yet.

Cellular automata file consit of lines, where which line consist of 4 parts:
<qrent color> <number of neighbors> <color of neighbors> <new color>

it is very simple, look at examples:

Game of Life:
1 !23 1 0
0 3 1 1

Brian's Brain:
0 2 1 1
1 -1 -1 15
15 -1 -1 0

Elementary cellular automata file consit of lines, where which line consist of 2 parts:
<combination of neighbors in previous line> <new color>

example:

Rule110:
111 0
110 1
101 1
100 0
011 1
010 1
001 1
000 0
